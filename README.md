# Parser

This is just a simple Demo Project showing how to use [Tree Sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) to parse source code.
I use Kotlin as an example.
You can run the included Unit Test to see the parser in action. 
A launch config is included, so you can step through the code of the test.
Simply set some breakpoints and press `F5`.

Note that the parser is very simplified. 
It's just meant as a simple tutorial.
You can build upon it, though.

## Dev Container

A Dev Container is provided to develop and test this demo.

To use the Dev Container you must have [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed on your host machine as well as the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). 

Here are three video tutorials that will get you started with using Docker and Dev Containers:
